		<!-- pictureScroll is an idea I have about presenting a self portrait.  I have been rock climbing consistantly for a little over a year now and
		my upper body has become pretty toned.  I am still however carrying a lot of weight in my belly.  I wanted the picture to be of my self
		from the neck down to my waist.  I wanted the picture to start with an opaque bar on top with some text about "gains" and a bar on bottom
		covering my belly.  Then as you scroll down, the background picture will scroll up until the bottom of the picture is at the top of the bottom bar.
		The bottom bar will then say something about my big fat belly. -->
